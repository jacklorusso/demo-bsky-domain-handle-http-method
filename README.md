# Demo: verify a domain handle on Bluesky via the HTTP/non-DNS method with Astro

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/171b7258-572c-4132-90f4-9d45c91c9550/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/demo-bsky-domain-handle/deploys)


## ðŸš€ Do It Yourself

If you clone or fork this repo, inside of your project you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ .well-known
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ atproto-did.ts
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.html
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

If you run the build and navigate to `/.well-known/atproto-did` you'll be served plain text that reads `did:plc:yourDIDhere`. This is achieved with an
[Astro static file endpoint](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes).

```typescript
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";

export const GET: APIRoute = () => {
  return new Response("did:plc:yourDIDhere");
};
```

Update the `src/pages/.well-known/atproto-did.ts` file with your own DID,
build the site and deploy it somewhere (I like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)). Then you'll be able to verify your custom domain handle on Bluesky with the HTTP method!

This demo might be useful if you don't have access easy access to the DNS
records of your site or subdomain. You may not even want to maintain a
website there, you can just use this to bootstrap the domain
authentication! For example, my bot project [@helveticabot.jacklorusso.com](https://bsky.app/profile/helveticabot.jacklorusso.com) is on a subdomain of my website, but doesn't really need a web presence.

For more information read ['How to set your domain as your handle'](https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial) on the Bluesky blog.
